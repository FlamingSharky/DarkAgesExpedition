Credit to the sprites, models, and ideas to all of the dev team. I would list out which of the sprites and models and who coded what, but there would be too much of a list

Dev Team:

Juancgutro is a builder for the mod but he spends most of his time formulating and putting ideas more down to earth as creating them is easy, but it's hard to make them work piece by piece and fitting Minecraft. I would like to thank him for his work as he really helped us out and we wouldn't have what we got without him.

Here is a message from Juan:
Hey y'all! Maybe check out my 1.16.5 MC modpack on CurseForge - It's a pure medieval-fantasy experience for Minecraft. Hope you enjoy it as I'm always working on polishing it - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fantasia-adventures

Woahcool is a sprite artist who despite being the youngest in the team, he makes really high quality sprites even with just 20x20. He might be the youngest, but his knowledge for art is not bound by age as he probably has the most knowledge as all of us in Minecraft pixel art. His ideas, meanwhile not the most concrete, with his creativity added to it allowed us to evolve the ideas into what we have now.

Here is a message from Woah:
Nothing yet.

Divinity is a programmer for the mod, he's been working with his own mod recently but we hope to have a good time with him and helps us out carving this path of the journey we are taking.
